# Sales Prediction for Retail Stores

---

## Introduction

Retail businesses rely on accurate sales forecasting for optimization. Machine learning offers powerful tools for predicting future sales trends. The objective of this project is to develop models to forecast sales for individual retail stores.

---

## Objectives

- **Develop robust machine learning models for accurate sales prediction.**
- **Provide insights for store managers and decision-makers.**
- **Inform decisions regarding inventory, marketing, and resource allocation.**

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Historical sales data for 45 stores in different regions.**
- **421,570 instances with 5 attributes: date, weekly sales, store ID, and holiday indicator.**
- **Represents weekly sales data for specific stores.**

---

## Visualizations

### Weekly Sales by Store
- **Differentiate sales with and without holidays.**

### Sales by Store (Box Plot)
- **Visualize the distribution of sales across stores.**

### Sales by Store (Bar Plot)
- **Compare sales figures across different stores.**

## Machine Learning Prediction Models

We will build and test four ML models to check their accuracy and select the best model based on the R2 score (higher is better):

1. **Linear Regression Model**
2. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR) Model**
3. **Decision Tree Regressor Model**
4. **Random Forest Regressor Model**

### Model Performance
- **SVR Model:** Low accuracy with -12.9%.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Not a good fit with 3.01% accuracy.
- **Random Forest Model:** Good fit with 90.05% accuracy.
- **Decision Tree Regressor Model:** Best fit with 90.059% accuracy.

## Conclusion

- **Summarize findings and insights.**
- **Highlight practical implications for retail businesses.**
- **Discuss future research and improvements.**
